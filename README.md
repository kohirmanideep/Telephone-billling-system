Telephone billing system project is to present the requirement of   the Computerization   of     Billing   System.   The   project   thus   calculates   the   telephone   bills  automatically. It does almost every work which is related to automatic telephone billing connection system via- new connection , customer record modification, viewing customer records  & all works related to rate of bills, meter readings in addition to bill calculation and
bill generation.
          “Telephone Billing System” is developed as per seeing the increasing requirement tospeed up the work and incorporate a new work culture. Thus a new software has been
proposed to  reduce manual work, improving work efficiency, saving time and to providegreater flexibility and user-friendliness as the  system previously followed was totally manualone with lots of errors.
Since it is directly associated with the database, so there is very
little maintainability problem with this tool.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
Telephone Billing System is an approach by which the office staffs can store all the information about the customers, all the information of the Customers transaction and rectify them and review them whenever necessary. 
• The existing system is assumed to be a manual billing system and hence all the operations are assumed to be done manually by pen & paper works. 
• When any customer takes new connections then separate files were maintained. 
• Updating of data was very tedious job.  
• It was not easy to do several administrative works like managing rates of calls, addition or modification of metered calls & customer entries, modification of customer details
->Important features of this proposed system are:
* Consistent user interface with high economic features built into it. 
* System design in modular and structured way so as to make the integration 
with other subsystems easier.
 * User has complete control as it provides and accept only appropriate and valid 
data.
